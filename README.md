# Linked List - An Abstract Data Type

We will be creating a **module** that helps us generate a **Linked List**. A linked list is a data structure that contains **nodes**. Each **node** has a `value` and a `next` property. The `value` property contains some data that a user-defined when the node was created. The `next` property points to the next **node** in the list, ergo this is how the nodes are linked.

The last **node** in a Linked List will have a `null` value for the `next` property.

## Linked List Example

    {
      value: 'Ready Player One',
      next: {
        value: '1982',
        next: {
          value: 'Neuromancer',
          next: {
            value: 'Snow Crash',
            next: null
          }
        }
      }
    }

## Methods

### getHead()
Returns the value of the first node of the list

    linkedListExample.getHead(); // returns a node object...
    {
      value: 'Ready Player One'
      next: { ... }
    }

### getTail()
Returns the value of the last node of a list.

    linkedListExample.getTail(); // returns a node object...
    {
      value: 'Snow Crash',
      next: null
    }

### add(Value)
Takes in any data value and adds a new node to the end of a list. Returns the new node that was created.

    linkedListExample.add('The Stranger'); // returns the newly created and appended node...
    {
      value: 'The Stranger',
      next: null
    }

### get(Number)
Takes in a Number value and searches for the **Nth node** in a list and returns that node

    linkedListExample.get(2); // returns a node object...
    {
      value: 'Neuromancer',
      next: { ... }
    }

### remove(Number)
Takes in a Number value and searches for the Nth node removes it from the list. Should return `false` if the position is outside the length of the list.

    linkedListExample.remove(3);

### insert(Value, Number)
Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right.
